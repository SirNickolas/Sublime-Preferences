This repository contains a few preferences files for [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com), the
best source code editor ever. Preferences are highly personal, but any of these may occasionally be
useful for someone.

To use, just clone it somewhere into the `Packages` directory, which can usually be found at:

```
~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/ # Linux
%ApplicationData%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\ :: Windows
```
